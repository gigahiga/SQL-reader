Submission:

    Report: Create a PDF file, named <XX>.pdf, where <XX> is your student number. 
    (Project report format guidelines are provided in Appendix A.) 
    The PDF file should include your full name, email address and phone number. 
    (We may need to contact you during testing). 
    
    Code: 
    Create one folder, named Code_<XX>, where <XX> is your student number. 
    It should contain a README file and the Visual Studio 2019 Solution / CMake 
    code folder with all your code (integrated with Autotester) or the that we 
    will build, run and test.
    
    Test Cases: 
    Create one folder, named Tests_<XX>, where <XX> is your student number. 
    It should contain all your system acceptance test cases for at least ONE 
    SIMPLE program and FIVE queries. 
    
    Place the report and the two folders in another folder named <XX>, and archive 
    it in a file named <XX>.zip. Submit the archive to 
    LumiNUS -> TIC2003 -> Files -> Student Submission -> Iteration 1.
    
    Detailed guidelines for LumiNUS submission are given in Appendix B.
    
    You should submit only one copy of the report and code. For multiple submissions 
    received from the same student, we will mark the most recent one.
    
    You are strongly advised to carefully read all sections of this document to understand 
    the requirements. When in doubt, contact the teaching team as soon as possible for 
    clarifications.
    
    This iteration accounts for 15% of the final grade. See Section 6 for the rough marking scheme.
